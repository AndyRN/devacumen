This post goes into detail about my desktop, "Titan". Even though it's had many modifications since I first used the name, I like to think it's still the same PC that's given me incredible gaming and cinematic experiences, enabled me to learn & explore the world of programming and provided me with the tools to create over the years.

<i>Similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a>, right?</i>


## Case

<b><a href="http://www.corsair.com/en-gb/obsidian-series-350d-micro-atx-pc-case">Corsair 350D Micro ATX</a></b>

My first venture into the Micro ATX world. It's a lot tidier not having my PC take up so much space next to my desk. Also, it's so much easier move around or pack into the car. On top of that, the simple & clean design of this compact case comes is perfect.


## Motherboard

<b><a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5257">Gigabyte GA-Z97M-D3H</a></b>

Obviously, with a Micro ATX case, I need to have a Micro ATX motherboard. <i>Who needs those extra PCI slots anyway?</i>


## CPU

<b><a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/80807/Intel-Core-i7-4790K-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_40-GHz">Intel i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz</a></b>

Having the extra power and threads that the i7 offers over the i5 greatly increases the performance of development tools, such as Visual Studio & Android Studio. Seeing as there's no real benefit to gaming above an i5, this was the factor that landed the i7 in the Titan.

To keep it nice and cool (and quiet), I'm using a <a href="http://www.corsair.com/en-gb/hydro-series-h60-cpu-cooler">Corsair H60</a> CPU cooler. This was a solid choice as it's able to keep temperatures low even at peak stress without making any more than a low hum as the pump whirs away.


## GPU

<b><a href="https://asset.msi.com/resize/image/global/product/product_7_20160309182104_56dff910f1378.png62405b38c58fe0f07fcef2367d8a9ba1/1024.png">MSi GTX 970 - 4GB</a></b>

I've always been on Nvidia's side of the fence, but there was a lot of controversy surrounding the launch of this card. However, I've had nothing but incredible performance from it. Saying that, I am only running a dual 1080p setup... 


## RAM

![Corsair Vengeance DDR3](/assets/images/desktop-ram.png)

<b><a href="http://www.corsair.com/en-gb/vengeance-4gb-single-module-ddr3-memory-kit-cmz4gx3m1a1600c9">Corsair Vengeance DDR3 - 16GB (4x4)</a></b>

Four of these nicely fill up the RAM channels on the motherboard, alternating black & blue as an attempt to be stylish. Although, I'm yet to move into the world of DDR4.


## SSD/HDD

![Samsung 850 Evo](/assets/images/desktop-ssd.png)

<b><a href="http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/consumer/850evo.html">Samsung 850 Evo - 250GB</a></b>

In what seems to be a standard setup nowadays, I've installed my OS on here, along with any applications that I use day-to-day.

![Western Digital Caviar Black](/assets/images/desktop-hdd.png)

<b><a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=760">Western Digital Caviar Black - 1TB</a></b>

Then all of my games & media end up on this. I can probably do with having a second one in order to separate the games and media onto individual disks, but this will only end up happening when it needs to.


## PSU

![Corsair RM750x](/assets/images/desktop-psu.png)

<b><a href="http://www.corsair.com/en-gb/rmx-series-rm750x-750-watt-80-plus-gold-certified-fully-modular-psu">Corsair RM750x</a></b>

At this point I'm pretty sure it's <b>necessary</b> to get a modular power supply, how else can you achieve adequate levels of cable management?

Getting a 750W PSU makes the Titan comfortably future-proof, with a decent amount of breathing room for more storage or graphics cards.

<i>Row, row, fight the powah.</i>
